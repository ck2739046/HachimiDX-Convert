📖 [**中文 README**](readme_zh_cn.md)



A tool designed for the rhythm game `maimai`. Accepts chart confirmation videos and automatically outputs simai-format charts (`maidata.txt`).



## ✨ Highlights

- **Fully automatic chart conversion**
    - Supports recognition and duration inference for all note types: tap, slide, touch, hold, and touch-hold.
    - Supports variant classification for ex-note, break-note, and ex-break-note.
    - Supports automatic syntax inference for all slide notations.

- **Custom vision models**
    - Optimized specifically for maimai, with stronger robustness in complex scenes.

- **GUI-first design**
    - Everything is done through a visual interface.

- **Built-in editors**
    - Integrates [`MajdataEdit`](https://github.com/LingFeng-bbben/MajdataView) and [`MajdataView`](https://github.com/TeamMajdata/MajdataView/tree/431-NC-TH) so convertion results can be previewed and modified in one place.

- **Flexible inference backends**
    - Supports CPU / NVIDIA TensorRT / DirectML inference backends for compatibility with a range of hardware.

- **Handy multimedia tools**
    - Trim videos, sync audio, convert formats, adjust arcade timing, etc.





## 🎯 Model Training Data

All training data was gathered in-house:

- **Automated labeling**
    - A [Mod](archive/yolo-train/mod_dump_notes/Dump_Notes.cs) captures raw game data. A [script](archive/yolo-train/label_notes.py) turns it into annotations automatically. Coordinates and categories are highly accurate. This makes dataset construction efficient and convenient, and it can quickly produce large amounts of high-quality samples on demand.

- **Task-specific training**
    - Each of the three models uses a dedicated dataset and is optimized for its own task.
    - `train_detect` — identifies note positions
    - `train_obb` — identifies slide rotation angles
    - `train_classify` — determines variants such as ex and break




## 🧩 Technical Architecture

Code lives in `src/`, organized in three layers:

- **UI layer (`src/app`)**
    - Built with Qt.
    - Each feature has its own page.
    - Shared widget library ensures a consistent visual style and user experience.
- **Middle layer (`src/services`)**
    - Manages task queues, controls concurrency, and distribute status.
    - Subtasks run in separate QProcess instances, managed by a process manager.
    - Uses pydantic to validate params and build commands.
    - Services are modular, each with a clear role.
    - Exposes a unified API for frontend. 
- **Core layer (`src/core`)**
    - OpenCV for frame processing.
    - YOLO for visual recognition.
    - Elements path tracking.
    - Filters, converts, and processes data.
    - Infers note position, timing, and duration.
    - Converts to simai syntax.
    - Performs audio matching, synchronization, and arcade timing inference.




## 🚧 Known Issues

- **Touch / Touch-Hold**
    - Overlapping notes at the same spot are not supported.
    - Fireworks effects (`f`) are not supported.

- Songs are assumed to have a fixed BPM throughout and do not support BPM changes.

- Camera-captured footage (off-screen recordings) may suffer from angle, color cast, or exposure issues. This hurts accuracy for ex/break classification.
